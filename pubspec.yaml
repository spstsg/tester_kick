# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: SF UI Display Black
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/sf-ui-display-black.otf
  #   - family: SF UI Display Bold
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/sf-ui-display-bold.otf
  #   - family: SF UI Display Heavy
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/sf-ui-display-heavy.otf
  #   - family: SF UI Display Light
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/sf-ui-display-light.otf
  #   - family: SF UI Display Medium
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: assets/fonts/sf-ui-display-medium.otf
